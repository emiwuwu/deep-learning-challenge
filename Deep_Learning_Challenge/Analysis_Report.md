# Alphabet Soup Deep Learning Model Analysis Report

## Overview of the Analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to develop a deep learning model using a neural network for Alphabet Soup, a nonprofit organization. The organization seeks to predict the success of charitable organizations funded by them. The goal is to improve the allocation of funds to ensure that they are used effectively, which will help increase the impact of their donations.

## Results:

### Data Preprocessing

#### Target and Features:

- Target Variable(s): The primary target variable for our model is "IS_SUCCESSFUL," which represents whether the charitable organization's funding was used effectively (binary classification: 1 for successful, 0 for not successful).
- Feature Variable(s): The feature variables include multiple columns such as "NAME", "APPLICATION_TYPE," "AFFILIATION," "CLASSIFICATION," "USE_CASE," "ORGANIZATION," "STATUS," "INCOME_AMT," "SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS," and "ASK_AMT."

#### Removal of Variables:

- Several variables, such as "EIN" should be removed from the input data because they do not provide meaningful information for predicting the success of charitable organizations. These variables do not fall into either the target or feature categories.

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

#### Model Configuration:

-  `AlphabetSoupCharity.h5` incorporates a neural network model with a purposeful design, featuring two hidden layers comprising 80 and 30 neurons. The choice of sigmoid activation functions in these layers is optimal for binary classification tasks, as it scales model predictions between 0 and 1. Furthermore, training the model over 100 epochs provides ample opportunities for learning from the dataset, enhancing its convergence to an effective solution. Lastly, the single-neuron output layer with a sigmoid activation function aligns with the binary classification requirement (1 denoting success, 0 representing failure). This design balance aims to capture essential data patterns while avoiding overcomplexity.

- `AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5` introduces a neural network model meticulously constructed to address the unique complexities of the dataset. This model boasts three hidden layers, each leveraging the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function, allowing it to excel in capturing intricate data relationships. Furthermore, the number of neurons within these hidden layers and the learning rate were meticulously optimized through a hyperparameter tuning process, ensuring peak performance. The model was thoughtfully trained for 80 epochs, allowing for robust learning and adaptation to the data. Lastly, the inclusion of an output layer featuring a sigmoid activation function aligns with the binary classification task, providing a practical solution for distinguishing between success and failure.

#### Target Model Performance:

- The `AlphabetSoupCharity.h5` model fell short of achieving the desired 75% accuracy target in classifying whether a charitable organization's funding is used effectively. However, after extensive efforts in hyperparameter tuning, feature preprocessing, and early stopping, the `AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5` model was able to surpass this target. While the complexity of the task and the unique nature of nonprofit organization data presented challenges for the first model, the second model's success suggests that further model optimization or exploration of alternative machine learning algorithms may be required to attain the 75% accuracy goal.

#### Steps to Improve Model Performance:

To improve model performance, I took the following steps:

- Feature Engineering and Binning: In `AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5`, fewer columns were dropped compared to the original model, and a "NAME" feature was introduced as data points. A binning technique was applied to address rare occurrences in certain columns, all aimed at refining the feature set and enhancing the model's predictive capabilities.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: I employed Keras Tuner to fine-tune hyperparameters, which encompassed key aspects like the number of neurons, layer architecture, activation functions, and learning rate. This process involved multiple trials to discover the most optimal combination. The outcomes revealed that the tuned model incorporated additional layers and neurons compared to the  `AlphabetSoupCharity.h5` model, demonstrating a more complex and refined neural network architecture.
- Early Stopping: I implemented early stopping with a patience of 3 to avoid overfitting and achieve better generalization of the model.

### Summary:

The deep learning model crafted for Alphabet Soup, with the aim of predicting the effectiveness of charitable organizations' funding allocation, underwent substantial improvements. These included hyperparameter tuning, early stopping, and feature engineering, ultimately leading to the achievement of the challenging 75% accuracy target. Furthermore, it is valuable to explore alternative machine learning models such as Random Forest and XGBoost, renowned for their classification expertise. In conclusion, the deep learning model holds promise, and considering alternative models presents an exciting opportunity to further enhance accuracy and reliability in tackling this classification challenge.
